# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Overview
Convolutional Neural Networks are deep learning models specifically designed for processing grid-like data such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.

## Architecture Components

### Convolutional Layers
- **Filters/Kernels**: Small matrices that slide across the input
- **Feature Maps**: Output of convolution operations
- **Stride**: Step size of the filter movement
- **Padding**: Adding zeros around input borders

### Pooling Layers
- **Max Pooling**: Takes maximum value in each region
- **Average Pooling**: Takes average value in each region
- **Purpose**: Reduce spatial dimensions and computational load

### Fully Connected Layers
- Standard neural network layers for final classification
- Connect all neurons from previous layer to current layer

## Key Concepts

### Convolution Operation
```
Output[i,j] = Σ(Input[i+m, j+n] × Filter[m,n])
```

### Feature Learning
- **Low-level features**: Edges, corners, textures
- **Mid-level features**: Shapes, patterns
- **High-level features**: Objects, faces

### Backpropagation
- Gradient-based optimization
- Computes gradients through convolution operations
- Updates filter weights to minimize loss

## Advantages
- **Automatic feature extraction**: No manual feature engineering
- **Spatial invariance**: Robust to translations
- **Hierarchical learning**: Learns complex patterns
- **State-of-the-art performance**: Excellent for image tasks
- **Transfer learning**: Pre-trained models can be reused

## Disadvantages
- **Computational complexity**: Requires significant resources
- **Large datasets**: Needs substantial data for training
- **Black box**: Difficult to interpret decisions
- **Overfitting**: Can memorize training data
- **Hyperparameter sensitivity**: Many parameters to tune

## Common Architectures
- **LeNet**: Early CNN for digit recognition
- **AlexNet**: Breakthrough in ImageNet competition
- **VGG**: Very deep networks with small filters
- **ResNet**: Residual connections for very deep networks
- **Inception**: Multiple filter sizes in parallel

## Hyperparameters
- **Filter size**: Size of convolutional kernels
- **Number of filters**: Depth of feature maps
- **Stride**: Step size for convolution
- **Padding**: Border handling strategy
- **Pooling size**: Size of pooling regions
- **Learning rate**: Optimization step size
- **Batch size**: Number of samples per batch

## Implementation Notes
- Both TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations include:
  - Batch normalization for stable training
  - Dropout for regularization
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting
  - Learning rate scheduling
- Input data should be normalized (0-1 or standardized)
- Data augmentation can improve performance
