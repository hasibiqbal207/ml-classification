## üéØ Classification Types Explained

### 1. **Binary Classification** (`spam-detection/`)
- **What it is**: Classifying data into exactly two mutually exclusive classes
- **Example**: Spam vs. Not Spam, Fraud vs. Legitimate, Positive vs. Negative
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Only 2 possible outcomes
  - Classes are mutually exclusive
  - Often imbalanced datasets
  - Uses metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

**Best Algorithms for Binary Classification:**
- Logistic Regression (fast, interpretable)
- Naive Bayes (good with text, handles missing data)
- Random Forest (robust, feature importance)
- SVM (good with high-dimensional data)
- Neural Networks (complex patterns)

### 2. **Multi-Class Classification** (`newsgroups/`)
- **What it is**: Classifying data into more than two mutually exclusive classes
- **Example**: News categories, Image recognition, Medical diagnosis
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - 3+ possible outcomes
  - Classes are mutually exclusive (one sample = one class)
  - Can use binary algorithms with One-vs-Rest or One-vs-One strategies
  - Uses metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Macro/Micro averages

**Best Algorithms for Multi-Class Classification:**
- Random Forest (handles multi-class natively)
- SVM (with One-vs-Rest strategy)
- Neural Networks (especially deep learning)
- Decision Trees (interpretable)
- k-NN (simple, effective for small datasets)

### 3. **Multi-Label Classification** (`emotion-analysis/`)
- **What it is**: Classifying data where each sample can belong to multiple classes simultaneously
- **Example**: Emotion detection (happy + excited), Tag prediction, Medical symptoms
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Multiple labels per sample
  - Labels are not mutually exclusive
  - Requires different evaluation metrics
  - More complex than binary/multi-class

**Best Algorithms for Multi-Label Classification:**
- Binary Relevance (treats each label as binary)
- Classifier Chains (considers label dependencies)
- Neural Networks (can learn label correlations)
- Random Forest (with multi-label extensions)
- Label Powerset (converts to multi-class)
